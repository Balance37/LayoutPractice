			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOjamajo Doremi ("Bothersome Witch Doremi"), 
			also known as Magical DoReMi in some countries, is a Japanese magical girl 
			anime television series created by Toei Animation. It focuses on a group of 
			elementary school girls, led by Doremi Harukaze, who become witch apprentices.
			The series aired in Japan on TV Asahi between February 1999 and January 2003, 
			spanning four seasons and 201 episodes, and was followed by an original video 
			animation series released between June and December 2004. An English language 
			version of the first season, produced by 4Kids Entertainment, aired in North 
			America in 2005. The franchise has also spawned two companion films, various 
			manga adaptations, and a sequel light novel series.
			<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDoremi Harukaze (Dorie Goodwyn in the American English dub), a third grade 
			elementary school girl living in the fictional Japanese town of Misora (Port
			Mystic in the English dub), comes across an esoteric shop known as the 
			Maho-Do, correctly guessing that its owner, Majo Rika, is a witch. 
			Due to a curse placed on any witch whose identity is discovered by a human, 
			Majo Rika is transformed into a magical frog. Wanting to return to her 
			original form, Majo Rika makes Doremi her witch apprentice, giving her the 
			ability to cast magic. In order to become a fully fledged witch capable of 
			turning Majo Rika into normal, Doremi has to pass nine different witch tests,
			whilst also keeping her identity a secret from other humans. Doremi is soon 
			joined by her two best friends, Hazuki Fujiwara /Reanne Griffith and Aiko 
			Senoo/Mirabelle Haywood , and later by her younger sister Pop , / Caitlyn 
			Goodwyn who all become witch apprentices, helping to run the Maho-Do whilst
			using magic to help out their friends and families, with the occasional 
			mishap. They soon come across a rival witch apprentice, Onpu Segawa,/Elie 
			Craft who has been using forbidden magic to influence people's memories. 
			Whilst initially cold towards the other girls, Onpu soon warms up to them 
			and sacrifices herself to prevent their identities from being revealed. 
			In order to save Onpu from an eternal sleep, the girls give up their magic 
			powers to awaken her.
